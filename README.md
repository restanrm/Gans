GANS is a tool to automate nmap scan.

Install GO
----------
Install go from the package downloader of your distribution or use official download from [https://golang.org/dl](https://golang.org/dl)

Create a workspace to load your code : 

	mkdir ~/.go
	export GOPATH=$HOME/.go
	export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.go/bin

(edit your .profile file if you want to execute this at every login)

Install GANS
------------
> go get github.com/restanrm/gans

It will download all the dependencies needed.

Using GANS
----------

Gans is used from a daemon process and some control processes. The command ``gans run``Â need root permission due to the ``nmap`` permissions that are required to do the scan. Here is a simple example to use gans.

You will need 2 terminals :

Here is the first one : (it needs root because it interacts with nmap)

> sudo ./gans run -d data.json

This deamon is now waiting for commands. It will read/write the infos it gathers/needs in the data.json file. (you can change this of course)

Open a second terminal and run the command 

> ./gans scan \<IP address(es)|IP address range(s)\>

ex :

> ./gans scan 192.168.0.0/24 192.168.2.254 172.16.0.0/12

You can then parse the data generated by GANS :

> ./gans parse data.json
